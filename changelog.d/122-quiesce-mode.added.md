- Host quiesce/maintenance mode (#122): `framework.quiesce()` drains
  in-flight turns (bounded, optional `abandon`), parks every subsequent wake
  (coalesced per agent+reason), pauses all MCPL data planes (control planes
  stay live), defers module/API context writes, and persists `hostMode` so a
  restart boots quiesced with a loud banner. `framework.resume()` gates on a
  fresh per-agent feasibility preview of the CURRENT settings (`force` to
  override; `ResumeBlockedError` carries per-agent verdicts), reopens data
  planes through the existing barrier funnel, flushes deferred writes and
  releases parked wakes. `framework.maintenanceTick()` runs one
  compression/maintenance pass on demand. Surfaces: `host/command` verbs
  `quiesce` / `resume` / `maintain` / `host-status`; WS `host.quiesce` /
  `host.resume` / `host.status` / `host.maintenanceTick`; HTTP `GET /hostmode`,
  `POST /quiesce|/resume|/maintenance/tick` (opt-in `ApiServerConfig.adminToken`,
  `x-admin-token` header always required on the POST verbs to force a CORS
  preflight). New traces `host:quiesce`, `host:resume`, `host:quiesced_boot`.
- Runtime-settings feasibility preview: `framework.previewAgentRuntimeSettings()`
  and `Agent.planRuntimeSettings()` expose the live→effective budget mapping;
  `updateAgentRuntimeSettings` preflights an immediate budget LOWERING and
  throws `BudgetPreflightError` when the folded floor cannot fit (paced
  descents, increases, no-op rewrites and boot restore are never blocked;
  `allowInfeasible` overrides).
- Review hardening of the above: `resume()` flushes deferred writes per
  message (a poison write cannot drop the rest or skip the data-plane
  reopen, which now runs in a `finally`); writes deferred while quiesced are
  persisted (`framework/deferred-writes` slot) and restored at a quiesced
  boot (`HostModeStatus.deferredWrites`); parked wakes coalesce per
  (reason, addressed) so a DM/mention parked earlier survives ambient
  traffic parked later; the `[1s, 10m]` drain clamp lives in `quiesce()` for
  every ingress; a `quiesce()` superseded by a concurrent `resume()` returns
  without abandoning anything; `resume()` waits for an in-flight maintenance
  pass instead of skipping the feasibility verdict; `abandon` reports turns
  it cannot cancel (`unabandonable`); `tool_results_ready` continuations pass
  the wake gate like budget restarts; `maintenanceTick()` returns `ran`;
  `nudge`/`unstick` replies carry `quiesced: true` while parked. ApiServer:
  WebSocket upgrades from foreign browser origins are refused
  (`ApiServerConfig.allowedOrigins`; same-host and non-browser clients pass),
  an empty `adminToken` is rejected at construction, `GET /hostmode` requires
  the token when one is configured, and `host-command` on the MCPL control
  plane means a surface `/undo` can now run ahead of pushes still buffered
  behind a startup/reconnect barrier.
- Review round 2: quiesce state and the deferred-write queue now live OUTSIDE
  branch history — `<storePath>/recovery/host-mode.json` and
  `recovery/deferred-writes.json` (`FrameworkConfig.hostModePath` /
  `deferredWritesPath`; the branch-local slot is only a fallback for
  store-only configs, with a warning) — so a historical rollback can no
  longer erase the marker of the surgery it belongs to or orphan the writes
  it deferred. A wake parked on provider admission behind an in-flight
  auxiliary call now rechecks quiesce when the auxiliary settles and is
  requeued instead of starting a turn; `HostModeStatus.parkedAdmissions`
  counts such wakes and `drained` is false while any exist. The resume flush
  acknowledges each deferred write durably as it lands and stamps its id into
  the stored message's metadata; boot recovers the queue regardless of the
  mode flag, skips ids that already landed, and the durable flag is cleared
  only after the flush completes — an interrupted resume neither loses nor
  duplicates a message.
- Review round 3: a flushed deferred write is removed from the durable
  recovery queue only AFTER `store.sync()` has made the appended chronicle
  slots durable (chronicle persists the slot-chain head on sync, not on
  append). Every deferred-drain path — resume flush, boot recovery, the
  turn-start / turn-end / puppet-end flushes — hands its batch to an
  un-acked set, writes, syncs, and only then rewrites the queue; a failed
  sync keeps the batch queued (retried at the next ack and at `stop()`).
  Regression coverage uses a real child process that `process.exit`s
  mid-resume, both right after the first acknowledgement and before the
  sync: the reopened host replays exactly the un-landed remainder.
- Review round 4: one durable id per logical deferred write across every
  hand-off. Every write that originates from the durable queue — the
  ordinary turn-start, mid-turn-injection, turn-end and puppet-end flushes,
  not only the resume flush — stamps `metadata.deferredWriteId`, and a
  re-deferral (target still busy or host still quiesced when a drained entry
  is written) moves the same entry back to pending under the same id
  instead of minting a second replayable one. Two more real child-process
  crash regressions: exit between an ordinary turn-start flush's sync and
  its queue rewrite, and exit at a re-deferral's recovery-file write.
- Review round 5: deferred-write entries carry a monotonic `seq` from first
  deferral; the durable queue is written, restored, drained and flushed in
  that order whatever the pending/un-acked split, so a re-deferred member
  of a batch keeps its place. Each hand-off persists a receipt of the
  target's store position before anything is written; boot dedup scans from
  that position to the tail (the whole store when a receipt predates it),
  never a fixed 2,000-message tail — a synced-but-unacked batch of any size
  is recognised in full. Recovery file/slot format is v2
  (`{pending, scanFrom}`); v1 is still read.
