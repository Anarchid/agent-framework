- `HistoryModule` adds `stats`/`extract`/`search` tools for querying an
  agent's full uncompressed message history by time range and/or channel
  (#151), backed by context-manager's native chronicle secondary-index
  queries — O(log n + k) against multi-million-message stores, not a full
  scan. Read-only, `bind(contextManager)` after `AgentFramework.create()`.
